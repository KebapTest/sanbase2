networkProfitLoss,decimal,"Network realized profit/loss computes the average profit or loss of all tokens that change addresses daily. For each token that moves on-chain, NPL takes the price at which it was last moved and assumes this to be its acquisition price. Once it changes addresses again, NPL assumes the token was sold.",N,N
mvrvUsdIntraday,decimal,"MVRV ratio computes the average profit or loss of a certain group of addresses based on the price(s) at which each token last moved.

  A module that takes a list of triggers and returns the ones that are triggered.

  The evaluation can be executed or the values can be taken from a cache. Taking
  data from the cache respects the last triggered datetimes, the cooldown value and
  all relevat trigger settings. Some of the fields such as the distribution channel
  (email or telegram), name and description of the signal, etc. are ignored
